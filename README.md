Description:
This is a console app developed using C# and Selenium that grabs all the text from the 'history' section on Microsoft's wikipedia page.  It then seperates all the words, removing the spaces and punctuation,  It then runs an algorithm counting the number of occurrences of every word using a dictionary and the top 10 words and the # of number of occurences are displayed.  At the begining, a user can decide to exclude any words they would like
